Hierarchical Neuronal Segmentation Algorithm
============================================

This is an algorithm designed for automatic segmention of complete neurons in electron microscopy data.

The core algorithm is in the "algorithm" directory while wrappers for it to do things such as run on a cluster are in the "wrappers" directory.

More details about running the algorithm or any of the wrappers is contained in readmes in the respective directories.
